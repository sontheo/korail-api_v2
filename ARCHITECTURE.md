# Source layout

The distribution has one implementation namespace and one compatibility namespace. Runtime dependencies point to the implementation packages. The `korail_mobile_api` modules forward imports and module identity to that implementation so existing monkeypatches, exception classes and model imports resolve to the same objects.

The wheel contains the two runtime namespaces and release documentation. The source archive also contains the standalone tests, artifact checker and catalog importer. The previous implementation and observation generators are not included. Captured decoder outcomes, validators, performance tools and reports are development-only.

## Where to change behavior

- Authentication and session transitions: `services/authentication.py`.
- Search validation and continuation values: `services/search.py`; client pagination is in `api/client.py`.
- Passenger, journey, designated-seat and limousine reservation rules: `services/reservations.py`.
- Card and settlement validation: `services/payments.py`.
- Remaining account/product query rules and operation orchestration: `services/operations.py`.
- Wire field mappings: `resources/contracts/requests.json`; their compilation and fresh per-call forms: `protocol/requests.py`.
- Response field conversion and raw error context: `protocol/codec.py`.
- HTTP status, cookies, form encoding and protocol rejection: `transport/http.py`.
- Already-decompressed curl responses and proxy handling: `transport/curl.py`.
- Queue admission, budgets and completion: `transport/admission.py`.
- Public constructor fields and signatures: `resources/contracts/public-interface.json`; model construction in `models/records.py`, concrete method annotations in `api/annotations.py`, and declarations in colocated `.pyi` files.

`services/operations.py` and the schema-driven model/decoder engines remain shared components. This reorganization establishes their ownership; it does not claim that every operation has already been converted into a separately authored explicit handler. Moving folders does not establish a copyright or attribution conclusion.

## Cache boundaries

Field interpretation plans, immutable date-validation results and resolved endpoint URL objects are cached. Every request receives a fresh form dictionary; client configuration, session values, current timestamps and query arguments are read on each call. Search responses, availability, queue passes and transaction outcomes are never cached by these optimizations. The form-plan cache is bounded to 512 entries the date-validation cache to 1,024 entries, and the per-client endpoint cache to 256 entries. Endpoint resolution is invalidated when the base URL changes and bypassed for client-level query defaults. Cookies, tokens and query/body values remain current on every request.

The offline contract suite remains the compatibility boundary when moving responsibilities into smaller handlers. Run it after changing a request rule, raw-response conversion or gate policy.

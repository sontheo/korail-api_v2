# Changelog

## 0.1.0.dev0 — development snapshot

- Reject invalid result envelopes and prevent queue error retries from exceeding the admission budget.
- Add shared in-memory maintenance cooldowns, server retry metadata, single recovery probes and optional SQLite persistence.
- Stop queue error bypass and final-failure sleeps; bound queue admission to 300 seconds by default (explicit `None` remains unlimited).

- Publish the current implementation in the new `korail-api_v2` repository, with a new Git history.
- Distribute as `korail-api` and preserve `korail_mobile_api` imports alongside `korail_api`.
- Preserve 239 public exports, 86 client methods and observed model/request contracts.
- Separate protocol, transport, service, configuration, model, message and security responsibilities.
- Retain tested failure context, queue behavior, error distinctions and transaction protections.
- Reuse resolved endpoint URLs and simplify common-envelope decoding; see `VALIDATION.md` for historical mock-search measurements and limits.
- Include standalone tests, typed public declarations, isolated artifact verification and CI.
- Keep runtime annotation installation compatible with Python 3.14's unified union types.
- Add English documentation, original banner artwork and explicit legal/provenance notices.
- Keep the previous implementation and history separately maintained.
- Remove historical reference license copies and attribution from the current distribution; retain notices for bundled data and actual runtime dependencies.

This development version has not been published to PyPI. Historical compatibility validation and live-service validation are distinct; this snapshot has no live authentication or transaction acceptance claim.
